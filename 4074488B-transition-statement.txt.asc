Hash: SHA1,SHA256

Tuesday, 5 June 2018

For a number of reasons, I've recently set up a new PGP key
and will be transitioning away from my old one.

The old key will continue to be valid for a short period after
the posting of this message, but future signatures will be
created from the new key. This message is signed by both keys
to certify the transition.


The old key was:

    pub   1024D/4074488B 2005-11-01
    pub   dsa1024 2005-11-01 [SC]
    Fingerprint: 6832 2BF9 D4E5 DC51 68F9  EA46 596F 2193 4074 488B

The new key is:

    pub   4096R/8E6CD3D7 2018-06-03 
    pub   rsa4096 2018-06-03 [C] [expires: 2023-06-02]
    Fingerprint: D7AD 3852 B3F8 A29A 1AB4  84CB 1009 EC3A 8E6C D3D7


Note that the signing of this message may have been done by a SUBKEY of
that key, which may make the key id listed in the signature not match
the fingerprint listed here. You can verify it by checking the key listed
here for the subkey used in signing this message.

To fetch the new key from a public key server, you can use the following:

    gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 8E6CD3D7

If you already know my old key, you can verify that the new key has been
signed by the old one, so the trail of signatures can still be followed:

    gpg --check-sigs 8E6CD3D7

If you don't know my old key, or you want to be extra careful, you can
check the fingerprint against the one above:

    gpg --fingerprint 4074488B

You can verify the signatures on this message by downloading the plain
text file as linked and running:

    gpg 4074488B-transition-statement.txt.asc

If you are satisfied that you have the right key, that the UIDs match what
you expect, and you are certain of my identity, I would appreciate it if
you would sign my new key:

    gpg --sign-key 8E6CD3D7

And finally, if you have signed it, to upload the signatures:

    gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key 8E6CD3D7

    
Sorry for any inconvenience.

Regards,
Florian Evers
